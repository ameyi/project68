<p>The school has been around teaching students for 30 years. The school community has picked up trash very recently. Many students who come from here get into good high schools like Jesuit, Francis, Christian Brothers, and maybe the top universities in the US. It has a goal of inspiring, empowering, and enriching us to be better.</p>
